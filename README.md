# design-for-data-quality
Data repository associated with a paper on Logical Schema Design for Data Quality

This repository contains python code and statistics for the experiments conducted in the paper above. 

The experiments involve the computation of schema designs on the logical level, as well as experiments that compute two update operations and two query operations on the database instances associated with the different schema designs.

In addition, the repository also contains the full version of our submission which includes all proofs.
